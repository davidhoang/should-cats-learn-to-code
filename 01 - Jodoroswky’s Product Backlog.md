# Jodoroswky’s Product Backlog

Jodorowsky’s Dune is about Chilean filmmaker Alejandro Jodorosky’s failed attempt at creating the Sci-Fi epic on film. Despite never making it on the big screen, this concept is often described as “The greatest movie never made”. It consistent of a star-studded production cast (many who joined the film Alien) and grand visions.

Spent $2 million of the $9.5 budget on pre-production with the film being about 14 hours long.

Years later, Jodorowsky would have to see David Lynch go on and do Dune, which failed. At the time this is written, acclaimed director Denis Villanueve will take on this ambitious sci fi projects.

Fast forward to the 90s with general magic.

An ambitious vision may live on like Jodorowsky’s Dune. It may inspire other people to come, but will live on exactly what it is...an idea that never happened and carried on by someone else.



What did these have in common? Vision never translated to execution, which led to its failure


The need to inspire
Vision itself isn’t enough
