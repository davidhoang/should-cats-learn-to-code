# Should cats learn to code?

Current status: Hella work in progress

This project is an open source book about Creative, Design, Tech, and Popular Culture. The intention is to create book which consists of a series of essays around the topics. See [Chuck Klosterman](http://chuckklostermanauthor.com/) as analogous inspiration. At some point this project will be open sourced to welcome contributions from other people, whether you're a designer, engineer, or product manager. If you get a pull request merged I will add you as a contributor to the book (unlikely as a co-author though).
